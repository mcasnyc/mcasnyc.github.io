      What is the story that lives inside the singer while singing
      the song? How do you make contact with your inner life
      so you can unlock and express the dramatic narrative
      while performing the song?  The meaning is in the images
      and the images can live in the body of the singer and
      flow outward to the audience. The song is a creative event;
      it’s meaning is supported by creative activity living in the
      singer. Chekhov Technique is a direct pathway to the performer’s
      expression. This technique workshop is specifically geared
      towards the expression of the singer. It is an introduction
      to the Michael Chekhov Technique for musical theatre actors.

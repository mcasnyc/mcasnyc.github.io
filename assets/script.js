      What is the story that lives inside the singer while singing
      the song? How do you make contact with your inner life
      so you can unlock and express the dramatic narrative
      while performing the song?  The meaning is in the images
      and the images can live in the body of the singer and
      flow outward to the audience. The song is a creative event;
      it’s meaning is supported by creative activity living in the
      singer. Chekhov Technique is a direct pathway to the performer’s
      expression. This technique workshop is specifically geared
      towards the expression of the singer. It is an introduction
      to the Michael Chekhov Technique for musical theatre actors.

    <div class='description-class-section'>
      This workshop is an active engagement with the Chekhov technique
      to rummage through the needs of both the actor and the character.
      We reach into the physical to find the radiating drama. The feelings,
      the thoughts, and the actions of the characters come together.
      The many parts of the Chekhov technique get passed through the
      imagination of the actor. The outer world of the play becomes
      the fully energized inner world of the actor.

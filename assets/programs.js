    The Dramatic Imagination

  </div>
  <div class='description-class-section'>
    This workshop is an active engagement with the Chekhov technique
    to rummage through the needs of both the actor and the character.
    We reach into the physical to find the radiating drama. The feelings,
    the thoughts, and the actions of the characters come together.
    The many parts of the Chekhov technique get passed through the
    imagination of the actor. The outer world of the play becomes
    the fully energized inner world of the actor.
  </div>
  <div class='description-class-section'>
    This is application of the technique in a scene study workshop.
    Introductory training in the Chekhov Technique is required.

  <div class='description-class-section'>
    What is the story that lives inside the singer while singing
    the song? How do you make contact with your inner life
    so you can unlock and express the dramatic narrative
    while performing the song?  The meaning is in the images
    and the images can live in the body of the singer and
    flow outward to the audience. The song is a creative event;
    it’s meaning is supported by creative activity living in the
    singer. Chekhov Technique is a direct pathway to the performer’s
    expression. This technique workshop is specifically geared
    towards the expression of the singer. It is an introduction
    to the Michael Chekhov Technique for musical theatre actors.

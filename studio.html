          <p>
            "This work has transformed me as an actor. It allows me to
            create without boundaries and is incredibly fun. I've never
            felt a sense of play as I do when using the Chekhov technique."
            - Sara Nedwick, Actor
          </p>
          <p>
            "It is a fun, playful, non-judgmental environment where actors
            can learn a physical acting technique that greatly engages their
            imagination and energizes their body." - Doug Lory, Actor
          </p>
          <p>
            “The work feels like play, it exercises my focus and teaches
            me to trust my own instincts. In conjunction with the Alexander
            technique this work makes me aware of energy and how I can direct
            it, utilize it and work with it.” -Christiane Seidel, Actor
          </p>
          <p>
            “Mr. Lenard Petit is the real deal! During class, he is always
            calm, cool and collected. When he is teaching or sharing you
            see his passion, his love in the work.” - Michael Semosh, Actor
          </p>
          <p>
            “I really appreciate the time taken with each student to ask
            questions, check-in, and process what is occurring for us as we
            encounter the work.” - Anna Dart, Actor
          </p>
          <p>
            "My imagination and play is coming back to life!" - Jessica Savage, Actor

            <p>
              Michael Chekhov developed an acting technique, a ‘psycho-physical
              approach’, in which transformation, working with impulse,
              imagination and inner and outer gesture are central. It offers
              clear and practical tools in working with imagination, feelings and atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chekhov's technique is a completely imaginative approach to
              experiencing the truth of the moment. According to Chekhov,
              the work of the actor is to create an inner event which is
              an actual experience occurring in real time within the actor.
              This inner event as it is being experienced by the actor is
              witnessed by the audience as an outward expression related
              to the contextual moment of the play. This event and the
              ability to create it belong to what Michael Chekhov calls the
              Creative Individuality of the actor, and is not directly tied to
              his personality. This Creative Individuality allows the artist
              actor to use parts of themselves that are not just the smaller
              meaner more banal elements that make up their daily life, but
              rather parts of their unconscious, where dwell more universal
              and archetypal images.

              There being forgotten by you, or never known to you they undergo
              the process of being purified of all egotism. They become feelings
              per se. Thus purged and transformed, they become part of the material
              from which your Individuality creates the psychology, the illusory
              "soul" of the character."

            In this way the ego of the character is not subjected to the ego
            of the actor, because the Individuality seeks a creative union
            with the character, and will not allow the smaller personality
            to invade the character thereby distorting this character into
            one more representation of the actor's personality. The actor's
            work continually becomes an artistic creation.

            Michael Chekhov, Nephew of the famous writer and dramatist Anton Chekhov,
            was an ideal pupil of Constantine Stanislavsky and considered by
            Stanislavsky to be his most brilliant actor. Marked by the Soviets
            for arrest, he escaped to the West bringing us his invaluable methods
            and techniques. In the US, he landed in New york. Later he headed to
            Hollywood. Notable actors who studied and attribute their careers as
            actors include the likes of Ingrid Bergman, Marilyn Monroe, Anthony
            Quinn, Clint Eastwood and more contemporary actors such as Beatrice
            Straight, James Spader, and Johnny Depp.

          <h3 class='section-header'>ORIGINS</h3>
          <p>
            All approaches to acting in America and Europe stem from the
            pioneering work of Constantine Stanislavsky. His unending quest
            for truth on the stage resulted in a revolution in the way an
            actor prepared and presented a role. In America, his system
            arrived in a nascent form and was arguably not developed,
            leaving us with naturalism as the actor's highest artistic
            achievement. This work has found its way back to Europe as a
            result of the American cinema and now prevails as the dominant
            approach to acting. Stanislavsky's research continued, however,
            and took him beyond naturalism. Among his followers, were three
            of the most important theater artists of the 20th century:
            Michael Chekhov, Yevgeny Vakhtangov, and Vsevolod Meyerhold.

            These artists helped the naturalistic theater flourish until
            they understood, along with Stanislavsky, that actors were
            artists; they needed to move away from the mere "photographic"
            representation of life by seeking truth in more inspiring ways.
            They believed strongly that life on the stage needed to be bold,
            expressive, and theatrical. Consequently they developed imaginative
            methods using psycho-physical techniques, exercises that use
            the undeniable connection between the body and psychology,
            movements and principles that generate various sensations
            and emotions. They found these techniques liberated and
            excited the actor to truthful expressions.

          <h3 class='section-header'>MOVING BEYOND NATURALISM</h3>
          <p>
            An article in the NY Times, "Dispensing With Dogma in the
            Education of Actors" (8/2/98), states, "...naturalism has
            sometimes seemed unequal to the task of portraying characters
            on the stage. And there is renewed interest now in discovering
            ways to train actors that go beyond the Method."
          </p>

          <p>
            The acting community is hungry for alternatives to the Method.
            The Michael Chekhov Technique, rooted in Stanislavsky, influenced
            by Meyerhold and Vakhtangov, is one of the most viable alternatives.
          </p>

          <p>
            Following Michael Chekhov's Technique an actor gains freedom of
            all limitations of the subjective personality and has endless
            opportunities for the creative authorship in any theater system,
            director's conception, or performance structure.
